Front End Assessment

DUE DATE: 48 hours from when you received the email, good luck! When structuring your code please aim to make it modular, reusable and easy to maintain. Write it so that a different developer would be able to quickly read it, extend it to contain other features, etc. Commenting non-trivial code is always a good practice as well.Also note that above all, we’re looking for quality over quantity. So don’t rush yourself to complete everything if you’re running out of time. Selecting a few elements to perfect is a good approach.Good luck!XD Design Link:
